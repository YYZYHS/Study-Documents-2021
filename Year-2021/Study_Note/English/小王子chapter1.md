+ Q1：作者为什么要把《小王子》献给莱昂·沃斯？
+ A1：All grown-ups were once children -- although few of them remember it.

>serious reason:
>Leon Werth is the best friend he has in the world.
>another reason:
>As a grown-up, Leon Werth understands everything, even books about children.
>the third reason:
>Leon Werth lives in France where he is hungry and cold. The author thinks he needs cheering up.
>the last reason:
>Leon Werth was a child. The author demand to dedicate the book to zhe child from whom this grown-up grew.

+ Q2：叙述者幼年的创造力是如何被激发并表现的？
+ A2：他小时候看书，看到蟒蛇捕食，于是画了一幅看起来像帽子的蟒蛇吃大象图，大人看不出来，他为了解释，又把蟒蛇肚子化成透明的了。

>Once when I was six years old I saw a magnificent picture in a book, called True Stories from Nature, about the primeval forest. It was a picture of a boa constrictor in the act of swallowing an animal.
>I pondered deeply, then, over the adventures of the jungle. And after some work with a colored pencil I succeeded in making my first drawing. My Drawing Number One.

+ Q3：为什么说narrator的创造力被成年人否定？
+ A3：大人们看完narrator的作品二号后，劝他不要去管或开着肚皮或闭上肚皮的蟒蛇了，而应该多去学学算数、地理、历史和语法，narrator因此大受打击，不再画画。

>The grown-ups‘ response, this time, was to advise me to lay aside my drawings of boa constrictors, whether from the inside or the outside, and devote myself instead to geography, history, arithmetic and grammar. That is why, at the age of six, I gave up what might have been a magnificent career as a painter. I had been disheartened by the failure of my Drawing Number One and my Drawing Number Two. Grown-ups never understand anything by themselves, and it is tiresome for children to be always and forever explaining things to them.

+ Q4：narrator成年后是做什么的？
+ A4：narrator成年后做了飞行员，几乎飞遍了世界的每一个角落

>So then I chose another profession, and learned to pilot airplanes. I have flown a little over all parts of the world; and it is true that geography has been very useful to me. At a glance I can distinguish China from Arizona. If one gets lost in the night, such knowledge is valuable.

+ Q5：narrator判断他人的方法是怎样的？
+ A5：他常年戴着他的作品一号，遇到觉得头脑清醒的人，就把画作拿出来给对方看，以判断对方是否真的有这个理解力，可结果往往事与愿违。

>Whenever I met one of them who seemed to me at all clear-sighted, I tried the experiment of showing him my Drawing Number One, which I have always kept. I would try to find out, so, if this was a person of true understanding. But, whoever it was, he, or she, would always say:"That is a hat."

+ Q6：面对不同的人，narrator会怎么做?
+ A6：如果遇上了“孩子”，他想和对方聊聊蟒蛇吞象，原始森林；如果遇到的是“成年人”，他就和对方聊高尔夫、桥牌、政治、领带之类的事情。

>Then I would never talk to that person about boa constrictors, or primeval forests, or stars. I would bring myself down to his level. I would talk to him about bridge, and golf, and politics, and neckties. And the grown-up would be greatly pleased to have met such a sensible man.
