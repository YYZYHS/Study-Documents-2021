+ Q1：narrator为什么会出现在沙漠里？

  > So I lived my life alone, without anyone that I could really talk to, until I had an accident with my plane in the Desert of Sahara, six years ago. Something was broken in my engine.
  > And as I had with me neither a mechanic nor any passengers, I set myself to attempt the difficult repairs all alone. It was a question of life or death for me: I had scarcely enough drinking water to last a week.

+ Q2：narrator为什么对小王子的出现感到特别惊讶？

  > Remember, I had crashed in the desert a thousand miles from any inhabited region.

+ Q3：小王子希望narrator做什么？

  > When at last I was able to speak, I said to him: "But-- what are you doing here?"
  > And in answer he repeated, very slowly, as if he were speaking of a matter of great consequence: "If you please-- draw me a sheep..."

+ Q4：当narrator拿出他的画作一号时，小王子是什么样的反应？

  > But I had never drawn a sheep. So I drew for him one of the two pictures I had drawn so often. It was that of the boa constrictor from the outside. And I was astounded to hear the little fellow greet it with, "No, no, no! I do not want an elephant inside a boa constrictor. A boa constrictor is a very dangerous creature, and an elephant is very cumbersome. Where I live, everything is very small. What I need is a sheep. Draw me a sheep."

+ Q5：narrator最后怎么实现小王子的要求的？

  > By this time my patience was exhausted, because I was in a hurry to start taking my engine apart. So I tossed off this drawing.
  > And I threw out an explanation with it.
  > "This is only his box. The sheep you asked for is inside."
  > I was very surprised to see a light break over the face of my young judge:
  > "That is exactly the way I wanted it! Do you think that this sheep will have to have a great deal of grass?"
  > "Why?"
  > "Because where I live everything is very small..."
  > "There will surely be enough grass for him," I said. "It is a very small sheep that I have given you."
  > He bent his head over the drawing:
  > "Not so small that-- Look! He has gone to sleep..."
  > And that is how I made the acquaintance of the little prince.
