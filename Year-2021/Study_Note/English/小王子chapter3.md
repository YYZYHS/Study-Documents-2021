+ Q1：narrator为什么花了好长的时间才明白小王子的来历？
+ A1：

>It took me a long time to learn where he came from. The little prince, who asked me so many questions, never seemed to hear the ones I asked him. It was from words dropped by chance that, little by little, everything was revealed to me. 

+ Q2：narrator为什么会生气？
+ A2：

>The first time he saw my airplane, for instance (I shall not draw my airplane; that would be much too complicated for me), he asked me: "What is that object?"
>"That is not an object. It flies. It is an airplane. It is my airplane." And I was proud to have him learn that I could fly. 
>He cried out, then: "What! You dropped down from the sky?"
>"Yes," I answered, modestly.
>"Oh! That is funny!"
>And the little prince broke into a lovely peal of laughter, which irritated me very much. I like my misfortunes to be taken seriously.

+ Q3：narrator和小王子关于盒子里的羊做了什么样的讨论？
+ A3：

>After a reflective silence he answered: "The thing that is so good about the box you have given me is that at night he can use it as his house." 
>"That is so. And if you are good I will give you a string, too, so that you can tie him during the day, and a post to tie him to."
>But the little prince seemed shocked by this offer: "Tie him! What a queer idea!"
>"But if you don‘t tie him," I said, "he will wander off somewhere, and get lost."
>My friend broke into another peal of laughter: "But where do you think he would go?"
>"Anywhere. Straight ahead of him."
>Then the little prince said, earnestly: "That doesn‘t matter. Where I live, everything is so small!"
>And, with perhaps a hint of sadness, he added: "Straight ahead of him, nobody can go very far..."
